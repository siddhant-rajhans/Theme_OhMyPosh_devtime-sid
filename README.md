## 🚀 What Are You Getting?

Here’s what makes this theme a must-have for every terminal ninja:

- **👤 User & Hostname:** Because who wants to be a nameless coder in the vast digital landscape? With a fancy diamond-shaped segment, your name will shine as you conquer the digital world.
- **🌿 Git Status:** Know exactly where you stand in your project with instant info about the current branch, unstaged changes, and those sweet, sweet commits waiting to be pushed. 
- **⏰ Clock (Yes, You Need It!):** Never lose track of time again (or at least know when that next coffee break is absolutely necessary). The current time is right there, clear and concise.
- **🗺️ Path Pathfinder:** Navigate like a pro! See exactly where you’re at in your file system with the current working directory displayed in a simple, no-nonsense way.
- **👁️ The Watcher:** Get a visual cue on whether your last command was a triumph or a tragic fail. Avoid those head-scratching moments of confusion—this theme’s got your back!

## 🛠️ Installation

Getting this theme up and running is easier than debugging your first Hello World program (we’ve all been there).

### Here's the drill:

1. **Get Oh My Posh!**: If you haven’t already, install OhMyPosh using the [official installation guide](https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/windows). You’re just a few commands away from terminal greatness!

2. **Get My Theme:** Clone this repository and grab your copy of the DevTime-Sid theme:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/siddhant-rajhans/Theme_OhMyPosh_devtime-sid.git
    ```
3. **Theme Time!**: After completely doing step 1 & 2. To apply this theme to your terminal prompt, paste the downloaded `Theme_OhMyPosh_devtime-sid` file in the `.poshthemes`file (where ohmyposh themes are downloaded).

4. In your terminal edit the command below before running(replace `/path/to/Theme_OhMyPosh_devtime-sid.json` with the actual location where you cloned the theme file):

    ```bash
    oh-my-posh init fish --config $HOME/.poshthemes/devtime.sid.omp.json | source
    ```

    And then researt the shell.
    
    If you’re not a bash fan or want to do it in some other shell, just swap `bash` for your shell of choice. Easy peasy!

## 🎨 Feeling a Little Picky?

No worries! This theme is all about customization. Dive into the JSON configuration file and tweak the colors, icons, and segments until your terminal prompt reflects your unique style. Make it yours!
